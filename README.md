# Overview

The WeatherApp is a Java application developed with the goal of demonstrating various aspects of the Java language like loops, data Structures, classes, HTTP requests, JSON parsing, exception handling, and user interface creation.

The weather application retrieves forecast information based on user-provided city or state input.

It uses the Geocode API to obtain the latitude and longitude of the specified location and then fetches the forecast from the OpenWeather API with this data.
